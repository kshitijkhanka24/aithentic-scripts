Introduction
In this lab, we explore the concept of fine-grained access control in AWS
Identity

and

Access

Management

(IAM).

By

implementing

selective

permissions on Amazon EC2, we ensure that users have only the necessary
privileges required for their tasks, reducing the risk of accidental or
unauthorized actions.

Objectives
1. Create a user ec2_operator with restricted permissions.
2. Attach a custom policy that allows starting and stopping EC2 instances but
explicitly denies terminating them.
3. Verify access by logging in as ec2_operator and testing the allowed and denied
actions.
4. Understand how fine-grained permissions enhance resource protection in
AWS.

Procedure:
1. Creating User


Go to IAM Dashboard > Users > Create User.



User name: ec2_operator, Check “Provide access to AWS Management
Console”, User Type: IAM user, Check “User must create a new password
at next sign-in”

2. Create a custom Policy


Go to IAM Dashboard > Policies > Create Policy



We create a policy that gives granular access to user, here user should
be able to Start and Stop EC2 instance but not Terminate it.



In policy editor, Under Visual mode, Select Service: EC2, Effect: Allow.
Actions Allowed: Under Write Actions > StartInstances, StopInstances,
DescribeInstances . Resources: All Resources.



AWS has created granular permissions spread across List, Read, Write,
Permission Management and Tagging. It also allows us to select
resources on which this policy is applicable.



After selecting permissions, we can choose whether to allow or deny it.



So in the first half, we allowed 2 actions, here we want to deny an
action. Click on Add More Permissions, Select Service: EC2, Effect: Deny.
Actions Denied: TerminateInstances, Resources: All Resources.

Finally, the ec2_operator should look like this.

4. Testing our granular policy


Log in as ec2_operator > Go To EC2 Dashboard > Launch Instance with
default settings.



Launch EC2 with default settings.

Since, we are not allowed to Terminate Instance, AWS throws us an
error when terminating it.

Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how fine-grained IAM policies can precisely control
user actions on EC2 instances. By granting start and stop permissions while
denying termination, we successfully prevented accidental deletion of critical
resources. This exercise highlights the importance of implementing leastprivilege access to maintain both security and operational reliability in cloud
environments.
