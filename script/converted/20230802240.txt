HAND CRICKET AI – Q-LEARNING PROJECT
A Reinforcement Learning project where an AI learns to play Hand Cricket using Q-Learning.
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
This project implements an interactive Hand-Cricket game with both AI and human gameplay modes.
The AI uses a tabular Q-learning algorithm to learn batting and bowling strategies by playing simulated matches
and updating its Q-table.
Features include:
Coin toss system
Multi-wicket cricket logic
AI learns from human patterns
Training visualization (Matplotlib)
Full 2-innings match system
